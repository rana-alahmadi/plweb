	<h1>Monstera deliciosa or “Swiss cheese plant”</h1>
	
    <p>There’s no doubt you’ve seen the “swiss cheese plant” all over Pinterest as they're one of the most popular indoor plants going around right now. Their lush green leaves with distinctive holes make a stunning statement in any room and they can grow to fit any space. Monstera plants prefer a warm climate away from direct sunlight and they benefit from regular cleaning with a soft, damp cloth.
      
  "Let the top 4cm of soil dry out between watering as over watering may lead to root rot, signs of this are yellowing or wilting leaves,” Gisele Zanier, founder of Beyond Sunflowers, a plant emporium based in Melbourne told Better Homes and Gardens. “For best results Monsteras should enjoy conditions that are fairly moist so avoid artificial heating and cooling, they will require monthly feeding in spring and summer when planted in containers."
      
In its natural habitat, Monsteras like climbing so provide it with some kind of stake or trellis for support.</p>
