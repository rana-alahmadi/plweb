  <h1>Fuchsia</h1>
	
    <p>Fuchsias look very tropical, but they actually enjoy cool temperatures in the 60 to 70 F range. This plant benefits from a winter rest, so do not expect a lot of flowers during winter. Bring the plants indoors before frost and trim them to about 6 inches. Place it a cool spot (45 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit) with low light. In spring, move the plant back into a sunny spot and resume watering regularly. New growth should start soon. Repot with fresh soil and begin feeding every other week.
Light: Full sun except in winter
Water: Water lightly when soil is dry
Color varieties: White, pink, red, purple or various combinations</p>
