  <h1>Tropical Hibiscus</h1>
	
    <p>Hibiscus adapt well to being indoors and may bloom all winter if kept in a very sunny window with bright, direct light. You can trim the plants, to shape them, but hibiscus grow slowly in winter and you may not see any new growth. If you do not have an ideally warm, sunny window, opt for a cool spot with average light and let them drop their leaves and go dormant. Keep an eye out for aphids.
Light: Full sun to partial shade
Water: Water daily; keep well drained
Color varieties: White, red, pink, orange, yellow, peach, purple flowers</p>
