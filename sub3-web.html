  <h1>Dracaena Massangeana or Mass Cane</h1>
	
    <p>This plant is popular amongst beginner green thumbs and it’s often an office staple thanks to its hardy nature. Mass Cane often grows between 1.2 to 1.8 metres tall with stalky stems and long, green leaves featuring light yellow and green stripes running through them. It’s a great option if you’re looking for a large plant. This plant is best placed in indirect bright light but it can tolerate low light. You’ll only need to water it once a week. However it’s important to note that Dracaena 'Massangeana' is toxic to dogs and cats so it’s not the best option if you have furry friends around the house.</p>
