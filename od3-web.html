  <h1>Coleus</h1>
	
    <p>Coleus is everywhere these days. The old-fashioned seed-grown varieties that prefer some shade make especially nice houseplants. If your plants are too large to bring in, coleus root quickly from cuttings. They like to be warm but will tolerate cooler nights and temperatures down to about 55 degrees Fahrenheit. Be sure to pinch off any flowers as they appear to keep the plants from going to seed.
Light: Indirect bright light
Water: Keep soil moist and feed monthly.
Color varieties: Purple, green, red, pink, yellow, and variegated foliage</p>
