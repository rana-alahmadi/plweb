  <h1>Epipremnum aureum or Devil's Ivy</h1>
	
    <p>Devil’s ivy, also known as golden pothos or pothos, is a fast-growing and forgiving vine, suited to any position in the house. Whether they're potted in hanging baskets or cuttings placed in glass vases, these plants are super low-maintenance and absolutely stunning.

The leaves are waxy and heart shaped with colouring dependant on cultivar –Wilcoxii are a mottled white and green, Marble Queen have more of a cream and grayish-green colouring, Neon is a shade of bright, light greeny-yellow and Tricolor have green leaves with yellow, light green and cream dappling.

They're highly drought tolerant and don't require regular fertilisation. Water Devil's Ivy deeply once a week and cut back to every other week in winter. Spring and summer is the best time to prune and propagate your plant, placing the cuttings in glass jars of water to encourage rooting.</p>
