  <h1>Abutilon</h1>
	
    <p>Abutilon, the flowering or parlor maple, is often grown in containers or beds as an annual, but it is actually a tropical shrub. Abutilon like bright light, from a south- or west-facing window, and warm temperatures of 65 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. Avoid drafts and feed every other week with a water-soluble fertilizer. Your abutilon can be pruned lightly in the fall, to maintain its size and shape, and will often bloom in early to mid-spring. Keep an eye out for pests.
Light: Full to partial sun
Water: Allow to dry out between waterings
Color varieties: White to pale yellow to deep coral and red flowers</p>
